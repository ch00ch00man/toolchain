thekogans_toolchain represents the first half of 'thekogans.net
development environment and build system'. the development environment
consists of the following components:

  - folder struture - to facilitate integrating the development
    environment with the build system, the following folder structure
    is prescribed:

      ~/development/organization1/project1
                                 ...
                                 /projectN
                   ...
                   /organizationN
                   /toolchain/Windows
                             /Linux
                             /OSX
                             ...
                             /common/bin
                                    /resources
                             /Sources.xml
                             /sources
                   /sources/organization1/Source.xml
                                         /projects
                                         /toolchain
                           ...
                           /organizationN

  - naming convention - specifies how the various build artifacts are
    named. for convenience, two naming conventions are supported:

    1. Hierarchical - $TOOLCHAIN_BRANCH/$organization_$project.$version$extension
    2. Flat - $organization_$project-$TOOLCHAIN_TRIPLET.$version$extension

  - environment variables - an extensive set of environment variables
    are set by $TOOLCHAIN_ROOT/common/bin/setenvironment.

  - toolchain - third party libraries and programs are built and
    installed in to $TOOLCHAIN_DIR.
