This folder contains the third party sources for thekogans.net
toolchain and build system. A convenient build script (bootstrap)
is provided to build the build system on Windows, Linux and OS X.

The rational behind maintaining my own toolchain is;

    - isolation - To minimize cross contamination with
      libraries installed on the underlying OS.
    - uniformity - To provide a uniform build environment
      (compiler flags...).
    - commonality - To provide a standard library naming
      convention (also aids in isolation).

To build the toolchain for your particular os-arch-compiler
($TOOLCHAIN_TRIPLET) run bootstrap form the bash prompt
(cygwin bash on Windows). This will take some time. When finished,
check $TOOLCHAIN_DIR to make sure everything is there. If the build
fails mid-stream, you will need to fix whatever's broken on your
system and re-run buildtoolchain. It will pick up where it left off.

IMPORTANT: On Windows the only thing you should need to install is
Cygwin (select GNU make and gcc during install). On Linux and OS X
you will need to make sure perl is installed.

Qt:

Qt is not distributed with the toolchain. At >400MB per archive (one
for Windows and one for Linux/OS X), it's way too bloated. It's only
used in mex (which is slowly replacing it with an internal canvas and
widget set). If you're using Qt, follow these instructions to build it
on your platform. The build system is fully instrumented to handle Qt
resources. Look at $TOOLCHAIN_ROOT/common/resources/Makefile to see
what lists need to be setup for various Qt resources.

To build Qt:
IMPORTANT: Qt cannot at this time be used in static builds.
- On Windows:
  - unzip qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.5.1.zip
  - configure.bat -prefix %TOOLCHAIN_DIR% -opensource -shared -opengl desktop
  - nmake install
- On Linux:
  - Make sure the following development libraries are installed:
    - On Ubuntu 15.04: sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev\
      libxcb1 libxcb1-dev libx11-xcb1 libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-keysyms1\
      libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-image0 libxcb-image0-dev libxcb-shm0\
      libxcb-shm0-dev libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev\
      libxrender-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-render-util0\
      libxcb-render-util0-dev libxcb-glx0-dev
  - IMPORTANT NOTE: On my Ubuntu 15.04 machine the build fails
    because of the libqtpcre, libqtharfbuzzng and libqtfreetype
    dependencies. To fix it, I had to build them manually like
    this:
    - Do the steps below.
      - If the build fails with:
        - 'error: cannot find '-l:qtpcre':
          - cd qtbase/src/3rdparty/pcre
          - qmake pcre.pro
          - make
        - 'error: cannot find '-lqtharfbuzzng':
          - cd qtbase/src/3rdparty/harfbuzz-ng
          - qmake harfbuzz-ng.pro
          - make
        - 'error: cannot find '-lqtfreetype':
          - cd qtbase/src/3rdparty/freetype
          - qmake freetype.pro
          - make
  - tar zxvf qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.5.1.tar.gz
  - ./configure -prefix $TOOLCHAIN_DIR -opensource -shared
  - make -j"$TOOLCHAIN_PROCESSOR_COUNT" install
- On OS X:
  - tar zxvf qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.5.1.tar.gz
  - ./configure -prefix $TOOLCHAIN_DIR -opensource -shared\
    -debug-and-release -no-framework
  - make -j"$TOOLCHAIN_PROCESSOR_COUNT" install
